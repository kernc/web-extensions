# Query Params Remover
## Browser extension to remove fbclid and "utm_" query params from URLs before they load.

FBclid - Facebook Click Identifier - https://fbclid.com/

utm - Urchin Tracking Module - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters

The full list of query params that get stripped out of URLs are (for now):
- fbclid
- gclid
- utm_source
- utm_medium 
- utm_campaign
- utm_term
- utm_content
- utm_name
- utm_id

### Firefox installation
Available on addons.mozilla.org as of August 2019.

### Chrome / Chromium / Brave installation
1. Menu -> "More Tools" -> Extensions menu
2. Toggle Developer mode on
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Click and "Open" on the folder of the add-on you want to install in dev mode 

This should stay installed even when exiting / restarting. Might get a notification pop up warning you about dev mode though. 
Going to look into getting this on the Chrome store soon.

### TODOs
1. Add utm_referrer, ?ref, ?ref_url, ?ref_src
2. Add functionality to remove the FBclid from copying URLs via "Copy Link Location" (right-click menu).
